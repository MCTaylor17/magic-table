Sorry for the delayed response, but I figure I only have one reply so I wanted to [make it count](https://magic-table.netlify.com).

Anyways, are you kidding?  It was incredible!  

I could argue that it was even a little too much.  

I'm not sure if you've seen it, but [that hotel room was incredible](https://youtube.com).

Unfortunately, the only video I recorded on the board was pretty meh...  

It turns out it had nothing to do with the battery.  

I've tested it a few times since and it seems to turn off from getting jostled.  

Also, the only footage I got was filmed on the sidewalks which turns out to be illegal or something...

I really liked your office and would have taken a few snaps but sometimes you don't know how to act in these situations.

Part of my volunteer work at ProductBC is taking pictures of events at cool offices around Vancouver.  

Besides some of the game studios, I can't think of another office as visually interesting as yours.  

Definitely none with as much class.

I understand you're probably confused why I'm contacting you over a month later.  

As I understand things, I didn't express my technical abilities very well during my visit. 

This actually doesn't surprise me.  

My role at BCIT was slightly atypical, not unlike the rest of my career path.  

After solving a wide variety of large-scale problems with code, I was recruited to work exclusively on... 

Well... 

Whatever I wanted.

---

Despite all the official public sector titles, my informal designation was "The Tinkerer".  

On paper, I was a coder, but in reality, I was filling any position that needed filling. 

I was actively encouraged to innovate, seek out new opportunities, and helping to induce change in a culture built around stability.

By the time it came down to the technical, I just handled it.

---

I knew this was a problem and pleaded for an experienced colleague or three.  

One of the primary drivers of my departure was a need to level up in my career and make up for lost time.

The worst irony was, at the very first meetup after return and with no prompt at all, someone mentioned practicing their whiteboarding skills.  

More recently, somebody wisely suggested whiteboarding is a performance, similar to a play.  

With hindsight, it's pretty clear I wasn't performing very well.

---

I'm actually happy to admit there are some tools missing from my toolbox.  

It's a function of opportunity cost.    

It's hard to be good at the things you've never practiced, especially in an industry that demands so much attention across other areas.
