## Notes:

* Caution: Risk of seizures.
* The controls are what they are.
* There are only 1,000 rows in this table.  
* HTML5 Canvas would be twice as easy but only half as much fun.
* None of these adjustments are useful for anything except visual effect.
* Scrolling 10,000 rows of data is going to be a bad experience, regardless no mattr.
* A more robust solution would measure the scrollTop from a confining parent element.
